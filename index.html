                <p>Here's an interesting article from <cite><a href="https://wowa.ca/bc-housing-market">https://wowa.ca/bc-housing-market:</a></cite>
                </p>
                <h2>British Columbia Housing Market as of October 2022</h2>
                <p>
                    BC home prices regained their footing in October 2022 as average prices increased slightly on a monthly basis. For October 2022, the average home price in British Columbia was $932,979. That’s a decrease of 3% year-over-year but up 1% compared to last month. Meanwhile, there were 5,242 residential sales in B.C. for the month of October 2022, a 5% month-over-month decrease and a 45.5% year-over-year decrease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    October 2022’s average home price is now 3% lower compared to last year. That’s the first time that the province has seen a year-over-year decline in its average home price since before the pandemic. It’s still a relatively mild decline compared to Ontario’s housing market, which saw an 8.5% year-over-year decline in home prices, but fell behind the neighbouring Alberta housing market, which saw its provincial average home price increase by 2% year-over-year. Looking nationally, BC is outperforming Canada’s housing market, where Canada’s average home price has declined by 10% year-over-year for October 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vancouver’s housing market remains the most expensive market to buy a home in Canada. For October 2022, the average residential home price in Greater Vancouver was $1,231,805, a 1% increase year-over-year and relatively unchanged compared to last month. That's higher than the Greater Toronto Area's average home price of $1,089,428, which decreased by 6% year-over-year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Fraser Valley, which includes Surrey, Abbotsford, and Langley, is the province’s second most expensive housing market this month. The average home price in the Fraser Valley was $952,950, a decrease of 8% year-over-year. The province's third most expensive housing market was Victoria. The average home price in Victoria was $943,834 in October 2022, a decrease of 4% year-over-year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Home prices in Powell River remain volatile. The average home price in Powell River is up 14% year-over-year to $577,107, which is up 4% compared to last month, but far below the $707,707 average price seen in August 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking within Greater Vancouver, the average sale price of a detached home was $2,032,651. Townhouses and attached homes had an average sale price of $1,216,435, while condo apartments had an average sale price of $769,290.
